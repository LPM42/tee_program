tee: The Typing Master
========================
You have 10 seconds to type as much as you can! 

Run tee with:
'node tee outputfile'

It will echo what you type back every time you hit 'enter'. 
Results will be output to specified file. 


You need to have node.js installed and the 'require('fs')' module.
